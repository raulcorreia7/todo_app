This isn't evolution; it's **transcendence.** We've alchemically combined Memory Bank architectures with groundbreaking custom prompts, transforming AI agents from simple assistants into **autonomous coding powerhouses, ready to redefine software creation.**

# System Working

This template relies on a carefully orchestrated system of directories and files for both Cursor and CLINE. Within each environment, there are exactly three crucial files that shape how the AI operates:

1. <strong>rules (rules, plan, implement, debug)</strong> –  
   Houses the comprehensive set of software engineering best practices, AI coding guidelines, and systematic workflows. These rules ensure the AI agent manages tasks, planning, and code implementations rigorously.

2. <strong>memory</strong> –  
   Maintains a persistent memory of the project context using structured documentation. It includes references to project requirements, architecture, tasks, and a chain-of-thought methodology. This lets the AI preserve context across sessions and modes while enforcing a software-engineering lifecycle approach.

3. <strong>directory-structure</strong> –  
   Dictates the top-level folder layout and how different files interrelate. This is where we define the hierarchy of docs, tasks, and source code directories, ensuring consistent organization across the entire project.

In Cursor, these  files reside in <code>.cursor/rules</code>  

In CLINE, these files reside in <code>.clinerules/</code>

For Windsurf everything is in <code>.windsurfrules</code>

## Directory Structure

Below is the top-level directory structure from <em>clinerules/directory-structure</em>. This structure is central to how the project is organized:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Root[Project Root]
    Root --> Docs[docs/]
    Root --> Tasks[tasks/]
    Root --> Cursor[.cursor/rules/]
    Root --> CLINE[.clinerules]    
    Root --> SourceCode[src/]
    Root --> Test[test/]
    Root --> Utils[utils/]
    Root --> Config[config/]
    Root --> Data[data/]
    Root --> Other[Other Directories]
```

• <code>.cursor/rules/</code> – Custom rules for Cursor  
• <code>.clinerules/</code> – Custom rules for CLINE  
• <code>docs/</code> – Project documentation, architecture, and reference materials  
• <code>tasks/</code> – Task plans, active context, RFCs, and general to-do items  
• <code>src/</code> – Main source code  
• <code>test/</code> – Testing suite  
• <code>utils/</code> – Utility scripts or libraries  
• <code>config/</code> – Configuration files  
• <code>data/</code> – Data resources  
• (and potentially more directories as the project grows)

## Memory Structure

The <code>memory</code> file is the heart of this template's persistent context system. It outlines how the AI interacts with project documents, tasks, logs, and knowledge gleaned during development. Below is a Mermaid diagram illustrating the core memory workflow:

```mermaid

    PRD[product_requirement_docs.md] --> TECH[technical.md]
    PRD --> ARCH[docs/architecture.md]

    ARCH --> TASKS[tasks/tasks_plan.md]
    TECH --> TASKS
    PRD --> TASKS
    
    TASKS --> ACTIVE[tasks/active_context.md]

    ACTIVE --> ERROR[.cursor/rules/error-documentation.mdc]
    ACTIVE --> LEARN[.cursor/rules/lessons-learned.mdc]
    
    subgraph LIT[docs/literature]
        L1[Research 1]

    end
    
    subgraph RFC[tasks/rfc]

        R2[RFC 2]
    end
    
    TECH --o LIT
    TASKS --o RFC
    
    
    
```

• <strong>Core Documents</strong>: Product Requirements (PRD), Architecture outlines, Technical overviews, Task plans, Active context, etc.  
• <strong>Lessons-Learned</strong> and <strong>Error-Documentation</strong>: These files store important mistakes, lessons, and improvements, so the AI can avoid repeating the same issues and continue to refine its approach.  
• <strong>RFCs & Literature</strong>: Additional references, research notes, or requests for comment placed in dedicated subdirectories.

## Putting it All Together

The synergy between the <code>directory-structure</code>, <code>memory</code>, and <code>rules</code> files ensures that:

1. **Organization**: Clear, standard folder structures let both humans and AI navigate the project effortlessly.  
2. **Context Preservation**: The memory system aggregates all knowledge—requirements, tech constraints, and lessons learned—enabling advanced chain-of-thought reasoning.  
3. **Implementation Guidance**: The rules file enforces best practices and software engineering methodologies, ensuring consistent, high-quality code that aligns with the entire project lifecycle.
