# Product Requirements – Luxury Todo

## Vision
A premium, offline-friendly todo app with elegant interactions, ambient audio, and theming. It should feel instantaneous, reliable, and delightful without sacrificing clarity or accessibility.

## Core Use Cases
- Create, edit, and complete tasks with optional descriptions.
- Filter tasks: all, active, completed.
- Clear completed items and delete all with safe confirmation.
- Persist tasks and preferences locally; recover state on reload.

## Experience Requirements
- Performance: interactions < 100ms; first input delay minimal on mid‑range mobile.
- Resilience: works fully offline; no hard errors if network features fail.
- Accessibility: keyboard reachable, ARIA labels on interactive elements, color contrast AA.
- Haptics/Audio: subtle, respectful; never blocks interaction.

## Theming & Typography
- Theme system uses CSS variables from `styles/theme-system.css`.
- At least 10+ curated themes; quick switching with immediate feedback.
- Font options: Inter, Playfair, SF Pro (extendable).

## Audio & Music
- SFX: discrete UI feedback gated by a global mute.
- Music: optional background player with play/pause, prev/next, volume, and gap silences.
- Persistence: remember music volume/mute and last track index.

## Gamification & Insights
- Achievements and lightweight stats (totals, completed, streaks) update in near‑real‑time.
- Daily summary, quotes, affirmations feel optional and non‑intrusive.

## Settings
- Single panel for: theme, font, sound toggle + volume, utilities (reset).
- Feature flags live in `js/environment.js`.

## Technical Constraints
- Static hosting (GitHub Pages). No server.
- LocalStorage for persistence via `storageManager` abstraction.
- Event bus for decoupled features; standardized names in `js/constants.js`.

## Non‑Goals (for now)
- Accounts, sync, multi‑device state.
- Heavy analytics; only lightweight, local insights.

## Success Criteria
- Task flows are fast and intuitive on mobile and desktop.
- No console errors in steady state; graceful fallbacks for optional features.
- Themes, fonts, and audio remain consistent between sessions.
- Confirmations use app modal (not native `confirm`).

## QA Checklist
- Add/edit/complete/delete tasks across filters.
- Reset to defaults clears settings, tasks, stats with confirmations.
- Theme/font switch updates UI immediately; maintains accessibility.
- Audio toggle and volume reflect in SFX and music; persist on reload.
- Offline usage: all core flows work without network.
